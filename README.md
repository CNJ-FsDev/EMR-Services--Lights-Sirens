# EMR-Services-Lights---Sirens

Welcome, Today I am here to 🎪show case my new micro-controller project “Emergency Services - Lights & Sirens” 🚨🚨🚨with the Raspberry PICO 🍇. 

Buzzer(Requires Sound ON)🔊 

POLICE CAR. 🚓 
AMBULANCE. 🚑 
FIRE ENGINE. 🚒 

The project is designed to emit the corresponding lights and sirens to the appropriate emergency services vehicle.
In this project Police, Medics, Firefighters all have a union to alert and make there presence noticeable for civilians and the general public of there coming and going.

With the PICO being powered by a battery pack which generates power to the PICO. I used Python 🐍 programming 💻 to read the input data of the buttons, so that when a specific button is pressed, it would then relate back to the PICO to run a ‘while loop for each ‘if’ or ‘elif’ statement, the big RED 🔴 button represents cancel/reset. As it is programmed to ‘break’ the loop so that another button’s input can be processed when restarting the cycle.
